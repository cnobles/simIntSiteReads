## Parameters for simulating reads for targeted sequencing analysis by the 
## INSPIIRED pipeline.
# Freeze or reference genome. Must be installed as a BSgenome package.
refGenome: hg38
# Width by which to reject sequences if they are near bases annotated as "N".
Nwidth: 3000
# Number of cores to parallel processing (max count).
cores: 5
# Minimum width of genomic DNA to have in simulated reads.
mingDNA: 30
# Mean genomic DNA within simulated reads.
meanSonicLength: 70
# Standard deviation of genomic DNA within simulated reads.
sdSonicLength: 251

# Sequences related to constructing templates include flowcell binding sequences
# known as P5 and P7, and spacer sequences SP1 and SP2 which separate portion
# of the reads from one another. For template schematic, refer to README.md.
seqs:
    # As observed from R1 sequencing direction
    P5: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAG
    SP1: ATCTACACCAGGACTGACGCTATGGTAATTGTGTA
    # As observed from R2 sequencing direction
    P7: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT
    SP2: AGTCAGTCAGCCAGACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTG

# Indexing: If simulated reads are to be dual index reads generated, set 
# the following to TRUE, otherwise FALSE for single index read generation.
# Refer to  README.md for diagram and required columns in metadata.
DualIndex: FALSE

# For R1 read when dual indexing is true, how many bases of the 
# linker are sequenced? Positive integer.
R1LinkerOffset: 0
